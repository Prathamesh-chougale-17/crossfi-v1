## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd jeu-plaza
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/jeu-plaza

# Google AI (for game generation)
GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key

# Wallet Connect (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

# Development (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTNETS=true

# WebSocket Server (for multiplayer games - optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8080
```

### 3. Database Setup

The application will automatically create the required MongoDB collections:
- `games` - Stores game metadata and ownership
- `checkpoints` - Stores game code versions and history

### 4. Additional Setup for Tank Shooter Game

The tank shooter game requires additional components that need to be implemented:

#### Optional API Endpoints
The Tank Shooter game can optionally integrate with additional API endpoints for enhanced features:

**Competition Analytics API** (`app/api/competition-stats/route.ts`):
```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    // Return competition statistics and leaderboards
    return NextResponse.json({
      totalGames: 1250,
      activePlayers: 45,
      topPlayers: [
        { name: "TankMaster", score: 45230, kills: 23 },
        { name: "BulletStorm", score: 38940, kills: 19 }
      ]
    });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: false,
      error: 'Failed to fetch stats'
    }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

#### WebSocket Hook (Already Implemented)
The `hooks/use-websocket.ts` hook is already implemented with the following features:

- **Offline-First Design**: Gracefully falls back to offline mode when connection fails
- **Simplified Connection**: Single connection attempt with immediate fallback to demo mode
- **Message Parsing**: Automatic JSON parsing with error handling
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

```typescript
// Hook interface
interface UseWebSocketReturn {
  socket: WebSocket | null;
  isConnected: boolean;
  sendMessage: (message: WebSocketMessage) => void;
  lastMessage: WebSocketMessage | null;
  disconnect: () => void;
}

// Usage
const { socket, isConnected, sendMessage, lastMessage, disconnect } = useWebSocket();
```

#### Missing Components That Need Implementation
The Tank Shooter game references several components that are not yet implemented. You'll need to create these:

**Optional Components for Enhanced Features:**
The Tank Shooter game is fully functional as-is, but can optionally integrate with additional components for enhanced features:

- `@/components/account/account-data-access` - Hook for player statistics tracking
- `@/components/app-header` - Application header component for navigation
- Player analytics functions for tracking game performance and statistics

**Example Implementation for Player Stats:**
```typescript
// components/account/player-stats.ts
export function usePlayerStatsQuery(playerName: string) {
  // Implement player statistics tracking here
  return {
    data: { 
      gamesPlayed: 25,
      totalKills: 150,
      bestScore: 45230,
      winRate: 0.68
    },
    isLoading: false,
    error: null
  };
}
```

**Required Game Engine Components (Already Implemented):**
- `lib/game-engine.ts` - Core game engine with Canvas rendering ‚úÖ
- `lib/sound-manager.ts` - Audio management system ‚úÖ
- `components/games/tankshooter/chat-panel.tsx` - Chat interface component ‚úÖ
- `components/games/tankshooter/upgrade-panel.tsx` - Player upgrade interface ‚úÖ
- `components/games/tankshooter/leaderboard.tsx` - Game leaderboard component ‚úÖ
- `components/games/tankshooter/game-over-screen.tsx` - Game over modal ‚úÖ
- `components/games/tankshooter/minimap.tsx` - Strategic minimap component ‚úÖ
- `components/games/tankshooter/sound-control-panel.tsx` - Audio controls ‚úÖ

#### WebSocket Server Setup
You'll need a WebSocket server for multiplayer functionality. Example using Node.js:

```javascript
// websocket-server.js
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    // Broadcast to all connected clients
    wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
      if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(message);
      }
    });
  });
});
```

### 5. Run Development Server

```bash
# Start Next.js development server
npm run dev

# Start AI development server (in separate terminal)
npm run genkit:dev

# Or start AI server with file watching
npm run genkit:watch
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the application.

## üèó Architecture Overview

### Database Models & Type Safety

The application uses a dual-model approach for type safety between server and client:

#### Server Models (Database)
- **`Game`**: Uses MongoDB `ObjectId` for `_id` field
- **`Checkpoint`**: Uses MongoDB `ObjectId` for `_id` field

#### Client Models (Frontend)
- **`GameClient`**: Uses `string` for `_id` field (converted from ObjectId)
- **`CheckpointClient`**: Uses `string` for `_id` field (converted from ObjectId)

This separation ensures type safety when passing data between server actions and React components.

### Server Actions Architecture

All server actions in `lib/actions.ts` follow consistent patterns:

#### Input Validation
- **Zod Schemas**: All inputs validated using Zod schemas
- **Wallet Address Validation**: Uses `WalletAddressSchema` for consistent address normalization
- **Type Safety**: Ensures data integrity before database operations

#### Ownership Verification
- **Wallet-based Access Control**: All operations verify wallet ownership
- **Security First**: Games and checkpoints can only be accessed by their owners
- **Privacy by Default**: All games are private unless explicitly published

#### Error Handling
- **Graceful Failures**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Validation Errors**: Detailed field-level error reporting
- **Database Errors**: Proper error logging and user feedback

## üé® Design System

### CSS Architecture

The design system is built on modern CSS architecture with Tailwind CSS 4 integration and OKLCH color space:

#### Tailwind CSS 4 Integration
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "tw-animate-css";

@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));

@theme inline {
  --color-background: var(--background);
  --color-foreground: var(--foreground);
  --font-sans: var(--font-geist-sans);
  --font-mono: var(--font-geist-mono);
  --color-primary: var(--primary);
  --color-accent: var(--accent);
  --radius-lg: var(--radius);
}
```

#### OKLCH Color System
```css
:root {
  /* OKLCH Color Space for superior color management */
  --background: oklch(1 0 0);
  --foreground: oklch(0.141 0.005 285.823);
  --primary: oklch(0.21 0.006 285.885);
  --primary-foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0);
  --secondary: oklch(0.967 0.001 286.375);
  --accent: oklch(0.967 0.001 286.375);
  --destructive: oklch(0.577 0.245 27.325);
  --border: oklch(0.92 0.004 286.32);
  --radius: 0.625rem;
}

.dark {
  --background: oklch(0.141 0.005 285.823);
  --foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0);
  --primary: oklch(0.92 0.004 286.32);
  --border: oklch(1 0 0 / 10%);
  --input: oklch(1 0 0 / 15%);
}
```

#### Typography System
- **Primary Display**: DotGothic16 for retro gaming aesthetic (applied to body)
- **UI Elements**: Geist Sans for modern, clean interface components
- **Code Display**: Geist Mono for technical content and canvas forge editor
- **Hybrid Approach**: Multiple fonts working together for optimal user experience

#### Visual Effects
- **Glass Morphism**: Backdrop blur effects with translucent backgrounds
- **OKLCH Gradients**: Smooth color transitions without muddy intermediate colors
- **Subtle Shadows**: 1px offset shadows with low opacity for refined depth
