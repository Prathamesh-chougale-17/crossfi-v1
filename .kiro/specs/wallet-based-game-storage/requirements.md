# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing AI-powered Canvas Game Editor by implementing wallet-based game storage and management. Currently, the application has wallet authentication capabilities and can generate games using AI, but games need to be properly associated with wallet addresses for user-specific storage and retrieval. This feature will ensure that each authenticated user can only access and manage their own games, creating a personalized gaming experience tied to their blockchain wallet identity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a wallet-authenticated user, I want my games to be automatically associated with my wallet address, so that I can access only my games and maintain ownership of my creations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new game THEN the system SHALL store the game with the authenticated wallet address as the owner
2. WHEN a user accesses the home page THEN the system SHALL display only games owned by their wallet address
3. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to connect their wallet before accessing game creation features
4. IF a user tries to access a game they don't own THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a wallet-authenticated user, I want to see a personalized dashboard of my games, so that I can easily manage and continue working on my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the home page with an authenticated wallet THEN the system SHALL display a grid of their games with thumbnails and metadata
2. WHEN a user has no games THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with a call-to-action to create their first game
3. WHEN displaying games THEN the system SHALL show the game name, creation date, last modified date, and number of checkpoints
4. WHEN a user clicks on a game card THEN the system SHALL navigate them to the game editor for that specific game

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a wallet-authenticated user, I want my game checkpoints to be saved with my wallet identity, so that my progress is preserved and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves a checkpoint THEN the system SHALL associate it with their wallet address and the parent game
2. WHEN a user loads the game editor THEN the system SHALL display only checkpoints for games they own
3. WHEN saving a checkpoint THEN the system SHALL validate that the user owns the parent game
4. IF a user tries to save a checkpoint for a game they don't own THEN the system SHALL reject the operation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a wallet-authenticated user, I want to be able to delete my games and checkpoints, so that I can manage my storage and remove unwanted projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user chooses to delete a game THEN the system SHALL remove the game and all associated checkpoints
2. WHEN deleting a game THEN the system SHALL confirm the user owns the game before deletion
3. WHEN a user deletes individual checkpoints THEN the system SHALL only allow deletion of checkpoints from games they own
4. WHEN a game is deleted THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the removal immediately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a wallet-authenticated user, I want my games to be private by default, so that other users cannot access or modify my creations without permission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game is created THEN the system SHALL set it as private to the owner's wallet address
2. WHEN querying games THEN the system SHALL filter results to only include games owned by the requesting wallet
3. WHEN accessing game editor routes THEN the system SHALL verify wallet ownership before rendering the editor
4. IF an unauthorized user attempts to access a game URL THEN the system SHALL return a 403 forbidden response
