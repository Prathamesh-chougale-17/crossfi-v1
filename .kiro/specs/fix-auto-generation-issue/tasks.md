# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze and identify auto-generation triggers in the current codebase
  - Review the GameEditorPage component to identify where AI generation might be accidentally triggered during loading
  - Examine the auto-save functionality to see if it's calling AI generation functions
  - Check the actions layer for any functions that mix data loading with AI generation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [-] 2. Create pure data loading functions that never trigger AI generation
  - Implement a new `loadGameData` function that only retrieves existing game and checkpoint data
  - Modify `getGameById` and `getGameCheckpoints` to ensure they never call AI generation
  - Create a `getLatestGameCode` function that returns the most recent checkpoint code without generation
  - Write unit tests for these pure data loading functions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 3. Fix the GameEditorPage component to prevent auto-generation on load
  - Remove any AI generation calls from the `loadGameData` useEffect hook
  - Ensure the component only loads existing data when visiting a game
  - Update state management to properly track when generation has occurred vs when data is loaded
  - Add proper error handling for data loading that doesn't trigger generation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 4. Remove auto-save functionality that was triggering AI generation
  - Removed the auto-save useEffect that was calling `generateGameWithCheckpoint` every 10 seconds
  - Eliminated automatic checkpoint creation on code changes
  - Added manual save functionality through `handleSave` function that creates checkpoints without AI generation
  - Users can now save changes explicitly through manual save or AI generation dialog
  - This prevents unwanted AI generation and gives users full control over when their games are updated
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 5. Ensure GameGeneratorDialog is the exclusive entry point for AI generation
  - Verify that the `handleGenerate` function in GameGeneratorDialog is the only place that calls AI generation
  - Add proper loading states and error handling within the dialog
  - Implement safeguards to prevent multiple simultaneous generation requests
  - Add a disabled state to prevent generation during other operations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Add proper state management and visual feedback
  - Add an `isGenerating` state to distinguish between loading existing data and generating new content
  - Update the Header component to show appropriate status indicators (prepared with Loader2 and Save icons)
  - Implement proper loading states that differentiate between data loading and AI generation
  - Add success/error messages that clearly indicate when generation has completed or failed
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 7. Create comprehensive tests for the fixed functionality
  - Write unit tests for the GameEditorPage component to verify no auto-generation occurs during loading
  - Create tests to verify that manual code edits are preserved without triggering AI generation
  - Implement integration tests that verify visiting existing games doesn't trigger AI generation
  - Add tests for the GameGeneratorDialog to ensure it's the only component that triggers generation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 8. Perform manual testing and validation
  - Test visiting existing games to verify no unexpected generation occurs
  - Test refreshing the game editor page to ensure games load with the same code
  - Test manual code editing to verify changes are preserved without triggering AI generation
  - Test the AI dialog to verify generation only occurs when explicitly prompted by the user
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
